The Journal Club is a highly successful informal meeting for students, residents, fellows, and staff. There is no limitation to the breadth of topics discussed. All fellows are assigned a day in rotation on which they will prepare a detailed review of a current journal article. The articles are distributed in advance of each meeting, and each fellow selects a faculty discussant to provide insight. Most trainees find this type of interchange to be an effective means of education, and members of the Division rely on Journal Club as a continuing source of new and interesting findings. For more information, contact Michelle Harris at 919-684-6854.</td>
